## Previous lecture important details
- All of the metrics like NDVI, NDSI (snow), NDWI (water) are all based on the reflectance/wavelength curve and taking the normalized difference between the highest and lowest points on the curve.
- Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) is an alternative to Earth Engine?

**Previous method**

Download data --> Stored on local drive --> Load into memory --> Processing on CPU/GPU --> See results

**Google Earth Engine method**

Access pre-loaded data --> Create processing graph --> Optimize computations --> Run --> Results.


## Google Earth Engine
- Use `ee` and `geemap` python packages for Google Earth Engine
- All `geemap` is really useful for is `geemap.Map()` function
- Use `ee` to connect to cloud project

- Instead of downloading data, Earth Engine lets us access pre-loaded data
    - Don't need to load it into memory or store it on local device
- Going to create a processing graph
    - Kind of like a numpy stack
    - Now going to write a series of instructions up front without doing it?
    - Build a series of operations on top of a set of imagery, then at the end, it actually goes and does it
- Lose introspection as opposed to sequential way of dealing with the data and processing it
- It will optimize computations and run parallelized by default
- Then after all of this you get your results
- Get data from here: [https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets)
- Google code editor for Earth Engine here: [https://code.earthengine.google.com/](https://code.earthengine.google.com/)

- Call `.getInfo` method on any Earth Engine object to get information about it
    - Docs wihtin the code editor linked above

- Bro is doing his in class example and types really fast so I'm not going to keep up.
