# First class!

- GIS = geographic information systems
- There is such thing as a "cloud mask" to mask out clouds
- Sun synchronous orbit = follow illumination of the sun

Remote Sensing
---
def. Acquiring information about a physical process on Earth wihtout physical contact
- Much more than just observing things from satellites
- Going to be looking at the use of satellite sensors to detect, classify, and characterize processes on earth
- Includes surface, atmosphere, oceans
- Do this via the mechanism of EM radiation


More definitions:
- **Passive sensor** = just rely on the reflection of sunlight
- **Active sensor** = emit a signal, measure the response
- **Raster data** = fancy word for "pixel" data
    - If the physical world is continuous, sensors are creating a discrete version of continuous reality
    - Capture discrete events of continuous processes
    - Each pixel is associated with a geographic region (place)
    - Can represent sensor data & derived data (anything derived from geography like a land use map)
    - Four attributes of Raster Data
        1. Spectral resolution = red, green, blue, thermal, IR, etc.
        2. Spatial resolution = scale at what is being captured
        3. Coordinate reference system = earth is not a perfect sphere; all calculations depends on the model / reference system that you use
        4. Spatial extent = bounds of what you're capturing
        5. (Bonus) Radiometric resolution = number of unique light intensity values the sensor can capture (ex. uint_8 values go from [0, 255])
    - Common file format is `GeoTIFF` 
- **Vector data** 
    - Points = (x,y) pair
    - Lines = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2)] pairs 
    - Polygons = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xN, yN)]
    - Is memory efficient (ex. only have to store like 4 points for a square instead of a shit ton with raster)
    - Polygons are effective at scale and can be zoomed like in/out without degrading in quality
    - Most likely in `GeoJSON` or `Shapefile` formats
- Raster is kinda like raw data, vector is what we're actually mapping
- Coordinate reference systems that we're used to are in WGS84 in raster data
